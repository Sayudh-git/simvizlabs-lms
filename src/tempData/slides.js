It helps pilots plan the route, navigate, manage aircraft performance, and follow the planned path. It also supports basic data exchanges with the airline and air traffic control. By automating many routine tasks, the FMGS lowers pilot workload, improves safety, and makes operations more efficient.`,

During this phase, the system allows the autopilot to engage as early as 50 feet above the ground or 5 seconds after takeoff, whichever comes later. When the aircraft reaches the thrust reduction altitude, the throttle levers are normally moved to the climb thrust detent, also known as the climb throttle lever angle.\n\nAt this point, when the FMGCS is operating in managed mode, the aircraft is guided both vertically and laterally along the programmed flight plan. If an engine failure occurs during takeoff and the engine-out SID diversion point is still ahead, the EOSID can be activated once the pilot confirms the engine-out condition.\n\nNote: The EOSID diversion point refers to the last identical leg type, or common point, shared between the original SID and the EOSID.`",

Step climbs and descents are entered on the Step Altitudes page, which can be accessed through either the Vertical Revision page or the Flight Plan page A.\n\nDuring cruise, the pilot can have the aircraft maintain a constant speed using what’s called a Constant Mach Segment, or CMS. The pilot can adjust the CMS start waypoint, Mach number, or end waypoint as needed. To perform a step climb or descent, a new altitude target is set on the Flight Control Unit, and the altitude change is initiated by pushing or pulling the altitude knob.\n\nEn route descents are typically started when the aircraft is more than 200 nautical miles from the destination, either by changing the altitude or adjusting the vertical speed.

Here’s an important note:
‘Bearing,’ or B-R-G, refers to the course from the aircraft’s current position to the ‘To’ waypoint.
‘Track,’ or T-R-K, represents the course outbound from the ‘To’ waypoint, continuing to the next waypoint.

Following that, we see the Estimated fuel at waypoint,
the Actual winds at waypoint,

Next, Distance from G-I-J to top of climb — this indicates how far it is from the GIJ waypoint to the aircraft’s top of climb.
